I work on programming and philosophy that contributes to the public good. I have much to learn, and I celebrate playful
creation over alienated wage labour. I think that being kind is important, and I love cats and birds.

I've been programming since I was a kid. I'm currently creating better open source alternatives to proprietary desktop
software â€” I'm one of the maintainers of the [Hare programming language](https://vladh.net/hare), and am working on an
unannounced desktop application. I am also [building a 3D game engine](https://vladh.net/peony) and am interested in
working on video game technology. I write about ways to [make programming better](https://vladh.net/manifesto), and
sometimes [teach others](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer) to appreciate programming things from scratch.

Previously, I spent 10 years running [a software company](https://www.saffron.so) that made web applications and data
visualisation tools. I also co-founded a company that made [retro gaming devices](https://vladh.net/submodule).

When it comes to philosophy, I write about the philosophy of work through the lens of alienation and moral social
epistemology. I am currently researching these topics at the [University of
Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/philosophy), and sometimes [write about them on my
website](https://vladh.net/alternatives-to-wage-labour). Check out [my handy reading guide on the philosophy of
work](https://vladh.net/wage-labour-resources).

I am interested in [music](https://vladh.net/music) and [languages](https://vladh.net/german-nouns).
