I've been programming since I was a kid, and I want to [make programming better](https://vladh.net/manifesto). I'm one of the core developers of the [Hare programming language](https://vladh.net/hare), and I try to [teach others](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer) to appreciate programming things from scratch.

I spend a lot of my time [building a game engine](https://vladh.net/peony) from scratch and thinking about ways to [change the way we think about work](https://vladh.net/alternatives-to-wage-labour).

Previously, I ran [a software company](https://www.saffron.so/) for 10 years and made [retro gaming devices](https://vladh.net/submodule).

I care about kindness and socioeconomic equality, [music](https://vladh.net/music), [languages](https://vladh.net/german-nouns), and I love cats and birds.
