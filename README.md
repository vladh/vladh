I've been programming since I was a kid, and I want to [make programming better](https://vladh.net/manifesto). I try to [teach others](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer) to appreciate programming things from scratch. My day job is running [a software company](https://www.saffron.so/) where I help developers do their best work for clients all over the world.

I spend a lot of my time [building a game engine](https://vladh.net/peony) from scratch and [making retro gaming devices](https://vladh.net/submodule).

I care about kindness and socioeconomic equality, [music](https://vladh.net/music), [languages](https://vladh.net/japanese-recommendations), and I love cats and birds.
