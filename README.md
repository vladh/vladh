I care deeply about programming and philosophy.

I've been programming since I was a kid. I'm currently creating better open source alternatives to proprietary desktop software â€” I'm one of the maintainers of the [Hare programming
language](https://vladh.net/hare), and am working on an unannounced desktop application. I am also [building a 3D game engine](https://vladh.net/peony) and am interested in working on video game technology. I write about ways to [make programming
better](https://vladh.net/manifesto), and sometimes [teach others](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer) to appreciate programming things from scratch.

Previously, I spent 10 years running [a software company](https://www.saffron.so) that made web applications and data visualisation tools. I also co-founded a company that made [retro gaming devices](https://vladh.net/submodule).

When it comes to philosophy, I write about inequality, alienation, markets and the philosophy of work. I am currently researching these topics at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/philosophy). I sometimes write about these topics on this website, and have also posted a handy reading guide on the philosophy of work.

I celebrate playful creation over alienated wage labour. I think that being kind is important. I am interested in [music](https://vladh.net/music) and [languages](https://vladh.net/german-nouns), and I love cats and birds.
