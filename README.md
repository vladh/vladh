I work on programming and philosophy that contributes to the public good.
I have much to learn, and
I celebrate playful creation over alienated wage labour.
I think that being kind is important, and
I love cats and birds.

I run [Peony Software](https://peony.software), a one-person software
development studio in lovely
[Edinburgh, Scotland](https://vladh.net/static/photos/full/20220607.%20Water%20of%20Leith,%20Edinburgh,%20Scotland.jpg),
where I work on next-generation spreadsheet software.
I'm also working on redirecting money to open source software developers
by building
[Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com)
and
[thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev)
together with friends.
When I find time, I co-maintain the
[Hare programming language](https://vladh.net/hare),
and
[work on my 3D game engine](https://vladh.net/peony).
Even more occasionally, I
[teach others](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer)
to appreciate programming things from scratch.

Previously, I spent 10 years running
[Saffron](https://www.saffron.so) â€”
we made web applications and data visualisation tools for places like the
[University of Oxford](http://www.cncb.ox.ac.uk/)
and the
[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/).
I also co-founded
[Submodule](https://vladh.net/submodule),
a company that made a Game Boy cartridge reader.

I'm a PhD researcher in the philosophy department of the
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/philosophy),
currently working on the epistemology of why we put up with exploitation,
and the
[philosophy and ethics of work and labour](https://vladh.net/alternatives-to-wage-labour)
more generally.
Check out
[my handy reading guide on the philosophy of work](https://vladh.net/wage-labour-resources).

I mostly unsuccessfully think of ways to build
[low-carbon software](https://lowcarbon.software).
I sometimes attempt to
[make music](https://vladh.net/music),
[take photos](https://vladh.net/photos)
and think about
[languages](https://vladh.net/german-nouns).
