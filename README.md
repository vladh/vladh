I'm a researcher working on software and philosophy that contributes to the public good.
I'm specialised in low-level programming, 3D graphics, web technologies,
political philosophy and epistemology.
I have much to learn, and
I celebrate playful creation over alienated wage labour.
I think that being kind is important, and
I love cats and birds.

I'm currently building, as of Oct 2024:

* [Peony Software][peony], a one-person software development studio in lovely [Edinburgh, Scotland][edipic], where I
  work on next-generation spreadsheet software.
* The [Open Source Pledge][osp], which is [creating a new social norm of companies paying open source maintainers they depend on][osp-phil].
* [thanks.dev][td], which helps companies figure out which maintainers they depend on, and to pay those maintainers.
* [The Hare programming language][hare], a cosier alternative to C, useful for operating systems and video games.
* [The Peony Game Engine][peony-game-engine], my experiment in building a game engine from complete scratch, because I
  was fascinated with game engines as a kid.
* [clumsy computer][cc], where I try to teach others to appreciate programming things from scratch.

I'm currently a researcher at:

* [The University of Edinburgh][edi], doing a PhD in Philosophy about why social conventions make us put up with
  exploitation, and about [work][work-post].
* [Low Carbon Software][lcs], a not-quite-yet collective thinking about how to reduce carbon emissions caused by
  software.

I previously built:

* [Saffron], a studio I spent 10 years running. We made data visualisation tools for places like the [University of
  Oxford][cncb] and the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation][bmgf].
* [Submodule][submodule], a company that made a Game Boy cartridge reader, allowing you to preserve your Pokémon save
  files.

Otherwise, I sometimes attempt, with mixed success, to [make music][music], [take photos][photos], and [think about
languages][german-nouns].
