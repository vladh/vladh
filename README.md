I care deeply about programming and philosophy.

I've been programming since I was a kid. Currently, I want to create better open source alternatives to proprietary
software, and to develop video games. I'm one of the core developers of the [Hare programming
language](https://vladh.net/hare), and am currently [building a 3D game engine](https://vladh.net/peony) from scratch,
as well as an unannounced desktop application. I write about ways to [make programming
better](https://vladh.net/manifesto), and sometimes [teach others](https://vladh.net/clumsycomputer) to appreciate
programming things from scratch.

When it comes to philosophy, I write about inequality and about how to improve the ways in which we work with each
other. I am currently researching the epistemic implications of alienation at
[UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/ucl-department-philosophy'). I sometimes [write about these
topics](https://vladh.net/alternatives-to-wage-labour) on my website, and have also posted [a handy reading
guide](https://vladh.net/wage-labour-resources).

Previously, I spent 10 years running [a software company](https://www.saffron.so) that made web-based applications and
data visualisation tools. I also co-founded a company that made [retro gaming devices](https://vladh.net/submodule).

I think that being kind is important, I care about [music](https://vladh.net/music) and
[languages](https://vladh.net/german-nouns), and I love cats and birds.
